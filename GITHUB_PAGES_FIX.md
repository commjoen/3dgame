# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Problem
The GitHub Pages deployment at https://commjoen.github.io/3dgame/ had reliability issues due to complex manual branch management and outdated deployment methods.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `deploy` job used manual gh-pages branch management instead of GitHub's official deployment actions
2. Complex shell scripts for branch initialization and file management prone to errors
3. No use of modern GitHub Pages deployment workflow
4. Container builds lacked proper optimization for multi-architecture support
5. Missing proper image metadata and labels for better registry management

## Solution Implemented
1. **Modernized GitHub Pages deployment**: Replaced manual branch management with official GitHub actions
2. **Enhanced container builds**: Added QEMU support and improved multi-platform builds  
3. **Improved caching**: Better build performance for both pages and containers
4. **Added security headers**: Enhanced nginx configuration with additional security
5. **Proper image metadata**: Added comprehensive labels for container registry

## Technical Details
### GitHub Pages Deployment
- **Before**: Manual gh-pages branch management with complex shell scripts
- **After**: Uses official GitHub actions:
  - `actions/configure-pages@v4` for setup
  - `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` for artifact upload
  - `actions/deploy-pages@v4` for deployment
- **Benefits**: More reliable, faster, and better error handling
- **Permissions**: Simplified to `contents: read, pages: write, id-token: write`

### Container Builds  
- **Enhanced multi-platform support**: Added QEMU for cross-platform builds
- **Better caching**: Improved build times with GitHub Actions cache
- **Comprehensive metadata**: Added proper OCI labels for better registry display
- **Tagging strategy**: Includes both `latest` and `main` tags for main branch
- **Architecture support**: Confirmed support for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`

### Dockerfile Improvements
- **Optimized dependencies**: Production-only install with ignore scripts
- **Enhanced security**: Added Referrer-Policy header and improved caching
- **Better structure**: Cleaner nginx configuration with proper cache settings
- **Metadata labels**: Proper OCI image labels for registry identification

## Expected Result
After merging this PR to main:
- ✅ **GitHub Pages deployment** will be more reliable and faster
- ✅ **Container builds** will have better multi-architecture support
- ✅ **Performance** improvements from better caching strategies
- ✅ **Security** enhancements with additional headers
- ✅ **Monitoring** improvements with proper image metadata
- ✅ **Future-proof** deployment using recommended GitHub actions

## Container Usage
```bash
# Pull and run latest stable version (AMD64/ARM64)
docker pull ghcr.io/commjoen/3dgame:latest
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name ocean-adventure ghcr.io/commjoen/3dgame:latest

# Access the game at http://localhost:8080
```
