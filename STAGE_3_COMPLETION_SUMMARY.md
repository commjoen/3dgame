## Stage 3 Gameplay Flow

```
üéÆ STAGE 3 COMPLETE GAMEPLAY LOOP:

1. Player spawns in underwater environment
2. 5 golden stars scattered around the level  
3. Player swims to collect stars using WASD/Arrow keys
4. Each star collection:
   - Plays collection sound effect
   - Creates particle burst effect  
   - Updates star counter in UI
5. When all stars collected:
   - Gate appears at back of level (glowing cyan portal)
   - Gate activation sound plays
   - Gate begins pulsing animation
6. Player swims to gate
7. Player enters gate collision area:
   - Level completion sound plays
   - Level counter increments
   - Gate resets for next level
   - New stars spawn
8. Cycle repeats for progressive gameplay
```

## Browser Compatibility

### ‚úÖ Tested Platforms
- Chrome/Chromium: Full functionality including audio
- Firefox: Full functionality with Web Audio API
- Safari: Compatible with webkit audio context
- Mobile browsers: Touch controls + audio (after user interaction)

### ‚úÖ Audio Compatibility
- Modern browser Web Audio API support
- Graceful fallback for audio initialization failures
- Autoplay policy compliance with user interaction requirement

## Ready for Stage 4

With Stage 3 complete, Ocean Adventure now has a complete core gameplay loop with:

‚è≠Ô∏è **Next Stage**: Mobile Optimization & Controls
- Enhanced touch controls for mobile devices
- Virtual joystick implementation
- Mobile-specific UI optimizations
- Cross-platform performance tuning

The game now provides a fully functional underwater adventure experience with collectibles, objectives, immersive audio, and progressive level completion mechanics.
