# GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue: GitHub Pages deployment fails immediately

### Symptoms
- Deploy job completes in under 1 second with failure status
- No deployment logs available (404 error when fetching logs)
- GitHub Pages site shows no content

### Likely Causes
1. **GitHub Pages not enabled for repository**
   - Repository Settings > Pages > Source should be set to "GitHub Actions"
   - If set to "Deploy from a branch", the Actions deployment will fail

2. **Missing repository permissions**
   - Repository needs to have Pages enabled in settings
   - Workflow needs proper permissions (contents: read, pages: write, id-token: write)

3. **Environment not configured**
   - The "github-pages" environment may need to be configured in repository settings
   - Environment protection rules might be blocking deployment

### Solutions
1. **Enable GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions source**:
   - Go to Repository Settings > Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Save settings

2. **Verify workflow permissions**:
   - Check that the deploy job has all required permissions
   - Ensure the repository has Actions enabled

3. **Test deployment**:
   - Trigger workflow run on main branch
   - Check workflow logs for detailed error messages

### Testing
To test if the issue is resolved:
1. Run the validation script: `./scripts/validate-github-pages.sh`
2. Push changes to main branch
3. Check workflow run status
4. Verify deploy job runs with debug output
5. Check if GitHub Pages site updates

### Validation Script
The repository includes a validation script at `scripts/validate-github-pages.sh` that:
- Tests the build configuration
- Validates GitHub Pages build output
- Checks asset paths and required files
- Provides step-by-step setup instructions

## Current Status
- Workflow uses modern GitHub Pages deployment actions
- Build process works correctly with proper base paths
- Deploy job configured with debugging output
