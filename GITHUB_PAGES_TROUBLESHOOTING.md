## Detailed Troubleshooting

### Issue: GitHub Pages deployment fails immediately

#### Symptoms
- Deploy job completes in under 1 second with failure status
- No deployment logs available (404 error when fetching logs)
- GitHub Pages site shows no content
- Error message: "github-pages environment not found"

#### Root Causes & Solutions

1. **🔧 GitHub Pages not enabled for repository**
   
   **Problem**: Repository Settings > Pages > Source is not set to "GitHub Actions"
   
   **Solution**:
   - Go to Repository Settings > Pages
   - Set Source to **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - Save the settings
   - Re-run the workflow

2. **🔐 Missing repository permissions**
   
   **Problem**: Repository doesn't have Pages enabled or lacks proper permissions
   
   **Solution**:
   - Ensure repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro/Enterprise for private repos)
   - Verify workflow has permissions: `contents: read, pages: write, id-token: write`
   - Check that Actions are enabled for the repository

3. **⚙️ Environment configuration issues**
   
   **Problem**: The "github-pages" environment needs manual setup
   
   **Solution**:
   - Go to Repository Settings > Environments
   - If "github-pages" environment exists, check protection rules
   - Remove any blocking protection rules or add required reviewers

4. **📝 Branch protection or workflow restrictions**
   
   **Problem**: Branch protection rules or workflow restrictions prevent deployment
   
   **Solution**:
   - Check branch protection rules for main branch
   - Ensure workflow has proper permissions to deploy
   - Verify no organizational policies block GitHub Pages

### Testing Your Fix

After making changes, verify the fix works:

1. **✅ Run the validation script**:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:github-pages
   ```

2. **🔄 Trigger a new deployment**:
   - Push a small change to main branch, or
   - Go to Actions tab and click "Re-run all jobs" on the failed workflow

3. **📊 Check the workflow results**:
   - "Prepare GitHub Pages Artifacts" should complete successfully
   - "Deploy to GitHub Pages" should either succeed or show clear error guidance

4. **🌐 Verify the live site**:
   - Visit `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/`
   - Game should load with proper assets and navigation

## Alternative Deployment Options

If GitHub Pages continues to have issues, you can use:

### 🐳 Container Deployment
```bash
# Pull and run the latest container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name ocean-adventure ghcr.io/commjoen/3dgame:latest

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

### 📦 Manual Deployment
1. Download build artifacts from the successful workflow run
2. Extract and upload to any static hosting service
3. Ensure proper base path configuration for your hosting provider

---

## Validation Script

The repository includes a validation script that tests GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
npm run validate:github-pages
```

This script:
- ✅ Tests the build configuration
- ✅ Validates GitHub Pages build output  
- ✅ Checks asset paths and required files
- ✅ Provides step-by-step setup instructions

---

## Current Status

✅ **Workflow Enhancement (Current Fix)**:
- Split deployment into preparation and deployment phases
- Added graceful error handling for missing environments
- Improved user guidance for configuration issues
- Build artifacts are always created successfully

✅ **Build Process**: Works correctly with proper base paths and all required files

✅ **Container Alternative**: Multi-architecture builds available as backup deployment option
